# Information gathering
* Employees (name and number of employees, role, positions and contact details,)
* Technology partners (technologies used, locations, computing platforms)
* Business partners (involvement, location, their trust relationship, and so on)
* Business/financial history, investments, and investor details
* Web presence (name and number of domains, where they are hosted, etc.)
* Physical locations (offices, data centers, partners, warehouses)
* Network topology and -architecture
* Technologies being implemented on the network
* E-mails, phone numbers, or any other personal information
* Company location, product names, and names of senior managers in the company
* IP block owned
* Administration and maintenance contact for target domain and IP block

## Passive information gathering
* Locate the target Web presence
* Examine the target using search engines
* Search Web groups
* Search employee personal Web sites
* Search Security & Exchange Commission and finance sites
* Search uptime statistics sites
* Search system/network survey sites
* Search on P2P networks
* Search on Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
* Search job databases
* Search newsgroups (NNTP)
* Gain information from domain registrar
    * Check for reverse DNS lookup presence
    * Check more DNS information
    * Check Spam database lookup
    * Check to change WHOIS information

## Active information gathering
## Technique
* DNS / WHOIS

## Non technique
* Search engine
* news groups
* mailing list


# Network mapping
* Find live hosts
* Port and service scanning
* Perimeter network mapping (router, firewalls)
* Identifing cirtical services
* Operating fingerprinting
* Identifying routes using Management Information Base (MIB)
* Service fingerprinting

# Vulnerability identification
* Identify vulnerable services using service banners
* Perform vulnerability scan to search for known vulnerabilities. Information regarding known vulnerabilities can be obtained from the vendors’ security announcements, or from public databases such as SecurityFocus, CVE or CERT advisories.
* Perform false positive and false negative verification (e.g. by correlating vulnerabilities with each other and with previously acquired information)
* Enumerate discovered vulnerabilities
* Estimate probable impact (classify vulnerabilities found)
* Identify attack paths and scenarios for exploitation

# Penetration
* Find proof of concept code/tool
* Develop tools/scripts
* Test proof of concept code/tool
* Use proof of concept code against target
* Verify or disprove the existence of vulnerabilities

# Gaining access & Privilege escalation
## Gaining access
### Gain Least Privilege
* Discovery of username/password combinations (e.g. dictionary attacks, brute force attacks)
* Discovery of blank password or default passwords in system accounts
* Exploit vendor default settings (such as network configuration parameters, passwords and others)
* Discovery of public services that allow for certain operations within the system (e.g. writing/creating/reading files)

# Enumerating Further
* Obtain encrypted passwords for offline cracking (for example by dumping the SAM on Windows systems, or copying /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow from a Linux system)
* Obtain password (plaintext or encrypted) by using sniffing or other techniques
* Sniff traffic and analyze it
* Gather cookies and use them to exploit sessions and for password attacks
* E-mail address gathering
* Identifying routes and networks
* Mapping internal networks
* Perform steps 1 to 6 again with this system as starting point


# Compromise remote users / sites
* Try to get remote access to other networks, sites
    => Follow again all steps

# Maintaining access
## Covert channels
* Identify Covert Channel Which Can Be Used
* Select the Best Available Tool for the Covert Channel
* Methodology - Setup the Covert Channel in the Target Network
* Test the Covertness of Channel Using Common Detection Technique

## Backdoors
* Setting up backdoors

## Root-Kits
* Setting up Root-kits 

# Covering tracks
## Hide files
* Hide files

## Clear logs
* check history
* Edit log files

## Defeat integrity checking
* Look for integrity checking and try to defeat it (file whiti signature, misconfiguration, ...)

## Defeat anti-virus
* Disable the AV services
* Block the central management port
